##1.29

When we force $\beta_{0}=0$, which means the interception would be $0$, thus our model always goes through the origin and only the slop $\beta_{1}$ determines our model. The plot must go through the origin.

##1.30

When we force $\beta_{1}=0$, our model is only determined by the interception $\beta_{0}$, whatever the slope is. The plot is a line which is parallel to $x$-axis and the interception of $y$-axis is $\beta_{0}$.
